## Overview

The challenge was to build out the social links profile and get it looking as close to the design as possible. A hover effect when the user goes over a link was also required.

I used only vanilla HTML and CSS to keep it as simple as possible.

I always liked the simplicity of this design when I first saw it years ago, and like the idea of using it as a "temporary" personal website.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
