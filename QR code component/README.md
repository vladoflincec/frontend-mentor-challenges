## Overview

The challenge was to build out the QR code component and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible. It's a great way to practice pure HTML and CSS skills, while also getting into a "coding flow". I tried making the code as simple as possible, while also using semantic HTML where it was appropriate.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
